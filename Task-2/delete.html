This Project is for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling of a loan prediction dataset. It starts by importing necessary 
libraries and loading the dataset. Then, it performs data exploration by checking the first few and last few rows, summarizing the statistics, 
and visualizing the distribution of numerical and categorical attributes. After that, it fills missing values with appropriate values such as mean, median, or mode.

Next, it performs exploratory data analysis by visualizing the distribution of categorical attributes using count plots and numerical attributes using histograms.
It also creates a new attribute called "Total Income" and applies log transformation to some of the numerical attributes to reduce skewness.

After that, it calculates the correlation between numerical attributes and visualizes it using a heatmap.
It then drops unwanted columns and encodes categorical attributes using label encoding.

Finally, it splits the data into training and testing sets and trains several machine learning models such as logistic regression, 
decision tree, random forest, and extra trees classifier. It also tunes the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier to improve its performance.

At the end, it calculates the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the random forest classifier.
Overall, this code snippet is a comprehensive guide to data preprocessing, exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
